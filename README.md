# BukkitMMO

This is a legacy project that was designed for Bukkit 1.6. It does not work on current versions of Minecraft.

It includes some basic features, such as a bank system, a crate system, and a damage multiplier system that's more like a traditional MMO compared to the regular Minecraft damage.

It also includes a very basic (and very hardcoded) spell system that served as recent inspiration for the dynamic spell system in my newest Minecraft project.
